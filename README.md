<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danicelistobon/holberton-headphones/master/images/headphones.jpg" width="100%"/>

## Learning Objectives

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

###### This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.

## More Info
#### Implement a design

Figma will be your friend!

During this project, you won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

It’s not an easy exercise, but it will be your life in company/start-up, you will discuss with designers, implement their work and make them review your implementation.

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

- Reset CSS styling
- Use variables
- Simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- Avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
- Simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.
